# IniTec-Intranet-Project.
This repository contains research and documents related to the implementation of an intranet at IniTec. It includes simple explanations of the intranet concept for employees, summaries of introductory articles, and a technical document aimed at the webmaster for planning and executing the project.

An intranet is a private network designed exclusively for an organization's internal use. It functions similarly to the internet but is only accessible to employees or authorized users within the organization. Intranets serve as a central hub for sharing information, resources, and tools, and they typically include features such as:

Document Management: Central storage for policies, manuals, reports, and other documents, making them easily accessible and searchable.

Communication Tools: Company news, announcements, message boards, and team chat tools help streamline internal communication.
Collaboration Platforms: Team collaboration spaces, project management tools, and shared calendars support team-based projects and tasks.

Employee Resources: Portals for HR resources like benefits, payroll information, and training materials provide easy access to employee services.

Enhanced Security: Access is controlled, ensuring sensitive company information is only accessible to the intended audience.
An intranet enhances productivity by centralizing essential tools and information, which helps employees work efficiently and communicate effectively, while also improving data security.
